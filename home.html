            <br>
        Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn,
        can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation to charity and
        increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it really is
        far better to give than to receive.
        
        Our own research into why people give supports this. We asked 700 of our generous donors to tell us what motivates them
        to give regularly to charity; 42% agreed the enjoyment they receive from giving as a key influence.</h3>

        <h3><span><b>2 GIVING TO CHARITY STRENGTHENS PERSONAL VALUES</b></span>
            <br>
        
        In our research, Why we give, a feeling of social conscience was the most widely-given reason to give to charity.
        Whatever type of charity work they supported, 96% said they felt they had a moral duty to use what they had to help
        others, a sentiment very much rooted in their personal values and principles.
        
        Having the power to improve the lives of others is, to many people, a privilege, and one that comes with its own sense
        of obligation. Acting on these powerful feelings of responsibility is a great way to reinforce our own personal values
        and feel like weâ€™re living in a way that is true to our own ethical beliefs.

        <h3><span><b>3.)GIVING IS MORE IMPACTFUL THAN EVER</b></span>
            <br>
       
        Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs, preventing the
        full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully there are ways to make the most of
        every donation to charity.
        
        If youâ€™re a UK taxpayer, you can boost the amount of every donation you make by giving through Gift Aid, an Income Tax
        relief created to help charities get the most out of the funds they receive. As Gift Aid enables the charity to recover
        the basic rate of tax on your donation, the scheme adds 25p to each Â£1 you give at no extra cost to you.
        
        There are many other ways to give to charity tax-effectively too, such as by donating straight from your salary before
        tax is deducted through a payroll giving scheme, donating shares to charity or leaving a charitable legacy in your Will.
        These methods of giving ensure your chosen charities benefit as much as possible from your support.
